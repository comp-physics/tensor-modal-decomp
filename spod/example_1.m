%% EXAMPLE 1: Inspect data and plot SPOD spectrum.
%  The large-eddy simulation data provided along with this example is a
%  subset of the database of a Mach 0.9 turbulent jet described in [1] and 
%  was calculated using the unstructured flow solver Charles developed at 
%  Cascade Technologies. If you are using the database in your research or 
%  teaching, please include explicit mention of Brès et al. [1]. The test 
%  database consists of 5000 snapshots of the symmetric component (m=0) of 
%  a round turbulent jet. A physical interpretaion of the SPOD results is 
%  given in [2], and a comprehensive discussion and derivation of SPOD and
%  many of its properties can be found in [3].

%% Load the test database.
%   'p' is the data matrix, 'x' and 'r' are the axial and radial 
%   coordinates, respectively.
load(fullfile('jet_data','jetLES.mat'),'p','x','r');

%% Inspect the database.
%   The jet is resolvend by 39 points in the radial and by 175 points in 
%   the axial direction. To use the SPOD(_) function, it is important that
%   the first dimension of the data is time, i.e. 5000 snapshots in this 
%   example. If your data is sorted differently, please use PERMUTE() to 
%   swap indices.

%% Calculate the SPOD spectrum of the data.
%   Check the output of SPOD(_) in the Command Window after execution: the
%   routine has segmented the data into 38 blocks of 256 snapshots each.
%   The segments, or blocks, overlap bei 50%, i.e. 128 snaphots overlap.
